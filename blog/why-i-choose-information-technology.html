				 Recalling my younger years where watching cool movies make you want to be like them, wanted to be a super hero having super cool and strong powers, having the fame you ever dreamed, and here‚Äôs me a wanna be cool tech. guy just like the movies I‚Äôve watched.  That‚Äôs why I choose I.T and to be honest I‚Äôm blaming those movies! Why they look so cool? and I‚Äôm not. My expectation is so far from reality.
			</p>
			<p>
					I remembering in my elementary days when my computer teacher ask me if I knew some basic computer skill and I‚Äôm proudly telling the whole class that I don‚Äôt even know how to turn on the computer. Telling my whole friends that I will never take course with a lot of math. But I ended up a course that full of math problems.   
			</p>
			<p>
							 A lot of struggles and doubts of why I choose this course. I‚Äôm not confident about my intelligent capacity for this field. I‚Äôm thinking should I drop college? Should I switch course? Should I continue my I.T journey?... after all those hesitation I choose to continue my I.T journey, with all of those obstacles there is someone there for you, to help you out, encouraging you to keep moving and never give up, sending phrases ‚Äúwe can do this‚Äù build my trust and the confident to fail. Having them is a real blessings.
			</p>
			<p>
							I faced my first year of college with the covid-19 pandemic. A new education protocols, it a big challenge for first timer. Aside from, low knowledge about the field, no proper equipment and risky internet connection, doing some programming using a smart phone, and 1.5 GB internet,  I have to overcome this challenges to get the life I desire. And knowing that I‚Äôm not alone in this journey, having the mindset that there is someone out there suffer more than what I‚Äôm suffering now keeps me thinking ‚Äúif they can do that, I can do this too‚Äù.
			</p>
			<h1 class="display-4 secondfont mb-3 font-weight-bold">Why I continue to be an IT student? </h1>
			<p>
				 Information technology have something I‚Äôm about to nurture, I realized that when I succeed this I.T journey will make me a lot of money if, only if I succeed I‚Äôm sure I will it will makes a lot of attempts. Why I continue I.T? I‚Äôm imagining I can work without talking to a lot people every single day. I can be a designer, an artist, I can build something in a computer and make profit out of it. That‚Äôs why I keep doing this because of those fancy ifs.  I want to see what happen if I never give up.

			<h1 class="display-4 secondfont mb-3 font-weight-bold">Why you should choose IT? </h1>
			<p>
				 The biggest advantage of choosing information technology as a career is that it has a very low cost of education as compared to many other career choices. You don‚Äôt need a 4-year degree to become an I.T. professional. Instead, you can get quick training to be certified in specific areas of Information Technology. This way, you save huge amounts of money that you may have otherwise spent on years of college tuition. The more knowledge and certifications you acquire, the more you‚Äôll advance in your career.
			</p>
			<p>
							For this reason, the information technology industry operates at a speed much faster than any other industry, and for this reason, there‚Äôs always a significant demand for highly-skilled workers. With advancements in cloud computing, big data, and cybersecurity, an aspiring information technology professional has a plethora of opportunities to pursue and grow. An I.T. professional never stops learning, and must always stay on top of the latest technological trends in order to be successful in the field. The more training and knowledge an I.T. professional has, the more employable he or she will be.
			</p>
			<p>
							It is a well-known fact that Information Technology professionals are paid well compared to other professionals. An I.T. professional with the right mix of certifications and experience can find a permanent position in either the public or private sector. Recently, many companies have been extensively hiring experts in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and network security to help enhance their current systems. Many I.T. jobs provide great career advancement opportunities for dedicated and hardworking I.T. professionals.
